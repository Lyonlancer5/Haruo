# Haruo
Locally-sourced domain-specific Discord bot, intended for experiments only.

### Intentions
This Discord bot is an amalgamation of conversions, compilations and old projects.
You may be wondering, why enforce a set of code rules in this repo?
It's for the sake of being readable years ahead from now, as the tendency to say
"How does this work again?" is something I personally want to avoid.

### License
Even though intended for experiments, sources under project Haruo is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License.
