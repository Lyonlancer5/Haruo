# Haruo
Locally-sourced domain-specific Discord bot, intended for experiments only.

Loosely based from [ClarityCafe/Clara](https://github.com/ClarityCafe/Clara).

### Intentions
This Discord bot is an amalgamation of conversions, compilations and old projects.

You may be wondering, why enforce a set of code rules in this repo?

It's for the sake of being readable years ahead from now, as the tendency to say
"How does this work again?" is something I personally want to avoid.

### Requirements
(idk why you would want to run this but okay then)

- Node.JS v10.12.0 or above
- npm v6.0.0 or above

### License
Even though intended for experiments, sources under project Haruo is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License.
