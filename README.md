# Project: Haruo

Discord bot intended for experiments, almost always broken or unfinished.

Loosely based from [ClarityCafe/Clara](https://github.com/ClarityCafe/Clara).

### Intentions

This Discord bot is an amalgamation of conversions, compilations
and old projects. The `master` branch may be broken most of the time.

You may be wondering, why enforce a set of rules in this repo?

It's for the sake of being readable years ahead from now, as the tendency to
say "How does this work again?" is something I personally want to avoid.

Although that won't probably happen, since my code style is not "consistent"
and highly depends on mood, stress, and amount of coffee consumed.

### Requirements

Why you would want to run this?
Probably shouldn't even ask w.
Requirements may change without this section being updated.

-   Node.JS v10.12.0 or above
-   npm v6.0.0 or above
-   Dependencies listed in `package.json`

### License

Even though intended for experiments, sources under project Haruo is licensed
